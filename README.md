# Bioinformatics Master Degree Report

## Outline brainstorming

### First Year :

* How can metagenomics analysis be improved ? Especially when taking into account ecosystems constraints or absence of reference genome
* Mixture model
* Statistical model exploration
* 

### Second Year 

* Compliance to bioinformatics standards
* (Code optimization)
* Results on cheese ecosystems

## TODO

* [ ] Outline draft
* [x] Check if supervisor has a github account
* [x] Number of pages

## Technical specifications

###Â Number of pages

Page number estimation from last year report.

## Random Ideas section

* Graphical abstract (like several journals)
* Don't forget named bibliography references (Author and al.2014)
* Verify how to write foreign abbreviations:
	+ Keep french abbreviations with english details between parenthesis? 
	+ Propose both abbreviations?
