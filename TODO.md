# To DO

- [ ] Graphical abstract (like several journals)
- [ ] Add legend to some (complex) TikZ pictures (see this [post](http://tex.stackexchange.com/a/54834))
- [ ] Glossaries?
- [ ] Define **coverage** with a figure maybe as it is a central term in this report.
- [ ] Bibliography with `natbib` or `biblatex` instead of `pandoc-citeproc`? in case it gets bigger. But watch out for changes in the way you cite: `[@ ]` vs. `\cite{}`.


# Done 

- [x] Create workflow like diagram for report. Adapt CNIEL presentation
- [x] Prepare markdown tree of files (with child) for report.
- [x] Create a Makefile to compile everything nicely
- [x] Create a Makefile to compile one part only (for review and testing purposes)
- [x] Foreign abbreviations (see issues)
- [x] Don't forget named bibliography references (Author and al.2014)
- [x] Find a way to export zotero bibliography and git it!
