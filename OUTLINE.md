#Â Outline : around a metagenomics analysis tool

Ecosystems particularities leads to :

1) identify  limits in existing **metagenomics tools** 
2) develop or adapt  


Tool GeDI :

# Improvements

- in terms of code (file size, speed, etc.) cf. Integration
- or exploration of taxonomic classification :
	+ Mixture model proof-of-concept 
	+ Model limits and (partial) solutions

# Comparison

- to existing tools (at the time)
- to new tools (Sigma, MicrobeGPS)

# Integration

- with FoodMicrobiome Transfert
- with Galaxy Platform
- with others tools through the use of bioinformatics standard files.

# Application

- to simulated datasets
- to cheese metagenomics analysis : 6 samples
